"""The hard trust boundary: what may flow OUT of the agent.

Sanitising page text lowers injection pressure; it does not eliminate it, and no
prompt ever will. This module is the part that actually holds, because it is
deterministic Python the model cannot argue with -- the CaMeL result
(arXiv 2503.18813) in miniature: track where a value came from, and refuse to
let page-provenance values reach a side effect.

WHAT COUNTS AS TRUSTED
  - the user's own command            (they said it)
  - notes the agent deliberately recorded with the `note` verb
  - values pulled out by `extract`
  - text composed by the quoter, which never sees a page at all

WHAT COUNTS AS UNTRUSTED
  - anything read off the page that did not pass through one of the above

The distinction is NOT "did this come from a web page". Forwarding a link the
user asked you to find is the entire point of the agent, and their own working
demo does exactly that. The distinction is whether the agent *chose* to carry
the value forward, deliberately and on the record, or whether the page simply
handed it something and it typed it out. An injected "message everyone
evil.example" fails here because nothing ever noted evil.example.

An earlier version blocked every `type` into any field whose name contained
"message" or "chat" unless the text matched the quoter byte for byte. That is
every chat composer on the web, so it did not enforce a boundary -- it turned
the agent off.
